## Why this exists

I built this SSH client for myself, to support my workflow at work. It's based on
[**OmnySSH**](https://github.com/timhartmann7/omnyssh) by
[Tim Hartmann](https://github.com/timhartmann7).

I don't follow the idea that everything has to be as tiny and lightweight as possible.
For me this is a tool, and it should simply work. If it needs a few hundred MB more RAM
for that, that's fine by me. So I did exactly what goes against OmnySSH's core idea: I had
it rebuilt in **Electron** by [Claude](https://claude.com/claude-code), in plain
**TypeScript** with **SvelteKit** for everything.

The tool isn't finished yet, but it already has a few new features. See the list below
for what works, what's in progress, and what's still planned.

## Features

| | Feature | What it does |
|:-:|---|---|
| ✅ | **Live dashboard** | A card per server with CPU, RAM, disk, uptime, OS and top processes. Detects running services (Docker, nginx, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis). Appliances without a shell can be watched with a plain TCP port check. Cards sort into folders you can collapse (make one with New folder, drag a card to move it), under a section with the shells on this computer. |
| ✅ | **Terminals** | Real PTY sessions in tabs, GPU-rendered with xterm.js. Copy on select, `Ctrl+Shift+C`/`V`, configurable right-click (menu or PuTTY-style paste). |
| ✅ | **Local terminals** | Shells on your own computer in the same tabs, no SSH needed: PowerShell, Command Prompt, Git Bash and every WSL distribution on Windows, your login shell and the other installed ones on macOS and Linux. |
| ✅ | **Two-panel SFTP** | Local and remote side by side, drag & drop (also from your file manager), parallel transfers, smooth even in folders with thousands of files. Shortcut badges for local folders (one can be where every SFTP tab opens), and two folders on the same server side by side to move or copy between — the copy runs on the server. |
| ✅ | **In-place file editor** | Double-click a text file to edit it with Monaco, the editor from VS Code, local or remote. |
| ✅ | **One-click SSH key setup** | Generates an Ed25519 key, installs it, verifies it, and optionally turns off password login, with automatic rollback if anything fails. |
| ✅ | **ProxyJump** | Hosts behind one or more bastions work everywhere: dashboard, terminal, SFTP. |
| ✅ | **Encrypted passwords** | Stored passwords are encrypted with the OS keystore (DPAPI, Keychain, libsecret). |
| ✅ | **1Password** | Read the address, port, user, domain or password of a host or a remote desktop connection from 1Password when connecting instead of storing it, and use SSH keys from the 1Password SSH agent. [How](#using-1password) |
| ✅ | **Import & export** | Share SSH hosts and remote desktop profiles as a file — one, a folder, or all of them. Jump hosts and SSH tunnel hosts come along. Passwords and key files never do; 1Password references do, so whoever imports the file just signs in to 1Password. Taken names: overwrite or rename, your choice. [How](#sharing-hosts-and-profiles) |
| ✅ | **Light & dark theme** | |
| 🚧 | **Snippets & automations** *(in progress)* | Save commands as snippets and chain them into automations on a canvas, run locally, in WSL or on a host, with parameters and the output of earlier steps, plus built-in steps: upload a file to the host (from this computer or from inside a WSL distribution), start a GitHub Actions workflow and wait for it (its release tag becomes the output), download a GitHub release file. Usable, but still changing. |
| 🚧 | **Remote desktop (RDP)** *(in progress)* | RDP sessions as tabs inside the app, next to your terminals (IronRDP, no extra window), or in the OS's own client (Remote Desktop on Windows, FreeRDP on Linux and macOS), signed in automatically either way. Drag files onto the session to copy them there, and save files copied on the remote desktop. Can tunnel through any SSH host, so machines behind a bastion work without exposing port 3389. Display, monitor, clipboard, drive and sound settings per profile. |
| 💡 | **AI integration** *(maybe in the future)* | Help with commands, explain output or errors, right in the terminal. |
| 💡 | **Plugin system** *(maybe in the future)* | Extend the app with your own features without touching the core. |

✅ done · 🚧 in progress · 📋 planned · 💡 maybe in the future

## Install

Download the file for your system from the [**latest release**](https://github.com/Sniphs98/Remoty/releases/latest):

| System | File |
|---|---|
| **Windows** | `Remoty-<version>-setup.exe` (installer) or `-portable.exe` (no install) |
| **macOS** | `Remoty-<version>-mac-<arch>.dmg` |
| **Linux** | `.AppImage`, `.deb` or `.rpm` |

> [!NOTE]
> Since it's an Electron app, it should in theory run on every system, **but so far I've
> only tested it on Windows.** macOS and Linux builds are produced automatically but are
> untested. If something breaks there, please [open an issue](#feedback-and-contributing).

The builds aren't code-signed, so your OS asks once on first launch:

- **Windows:** SmartScreen shows "Windows protected your PC". Click *More info → Run anyway*.
- **macOS:** right-click the app → *Open* → *Open*.
- **Linux AppImage:** `chmod +x Remoty-*.AppImage`, then run it.

**Updates:** the app tells you when a new release is out. The Windows installer version and
the Linux AppImage update themselves with one click ("Update now", then restart). The other
builds link to the release page to download it.

The app reads the hosts from your `~/.ssh/config` (it never writes to it) and stores its
own data in `%APPDATA%\remoty\` (Windows), `~/Library/Application Support/remoty/`
(macOS) or `~/.config/remoty/` (Linux).

### Using 1Password

**Addresses, ports, users, domains, passwords:** install the [1Password CLI](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started/)
(on Windows: `winget install AgileBits.1Password.CLI`) and turn on *Settings → Developer →
Integrate with 1Password CLI* in the 1Password app. Then, in a host's or a remote desktop
connection's settings, click **1Password** next to the hostname, port, user, password, domain (remote desktop) or default path (SSH), and
put the item's secret reference into that field (in 1Password: right-click the field → *Copy
Secret Reference*, e.g. `op://Servers/web-1/password`). The app reads them when it connects —
1Password may ask for Windows Hello or Touch ID — keeps them in memory for 10 minutes, and never
writes the values to disk.

**SSH keys:** turn on *Settings → Developer → Use the SSH agent* in the 1Password app. The app
asks the SSH agent for keys before anything else, so your 1Password keys just work. On Windows,
stop and disable the *OpenSSH Authentication Agent* service first, since 1Password's agent
takes over its place.

### Sharing hosts and profiles

On the dashboard, **Export all**, the export button on a host card or on a folder writes the
hosts to a `.remoty-ssh-hosts.json` file; on the Remote Desktop page, **Export all** or a
profile's export button writes a `.remoty-rdp-profiles.json` file. **Import…** on the same page
reads one back in.

- **Never in the file:** stored passwords and the path of your SSH key. After importing, a host
  that had a stored password needs it entered again (the import says which). A host without a
  key path signs in with your SSH agent, the 1Password SSH agent included, or your keys in `~/.ssh`.
- **In the file:** everything else from the form, and 1Password references (`op://…`). Someone
  with access to the same 1Password vault connects without typing anything.
- **Along with it:** the jump hosts a host goes through (ProxyJump), and the SSH host a remote
  desktop profile tunnels through, so the file works on a machine that has neither yet.
- **Names already taken:** the import lists them, and for each you pick **Overwrite** (your
  saved password and key for it stay) or **Rename**. References to a renamed host in the same
  file follow the new name.

## Development

You need **Node.js 22+** and npm. Docker is optional (for the integration tests).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sniphs98/Remoty.git
cd Remoty
npm ci
npm run dev:electron     # build and start the app
```

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | UI only, in the browser, for fast iteration on screens |
| `npm run check` | Type checks for both packages |
| `npm test` | Unit tests |
| `npm run test:e2e` | End-to-end UI tests (Playwright) |
| `npm run test:integration` | Tests against a real SSH server (`docker compose up -d --build` first) |
| `npm run package:dir` | An unpacked app for your system, in `release/` |

To try Remote Desktop against a real Windows, there is an optional Windows 11 test
machine in a container: see [docker/windows-rdp-target](docker/windows-rdp-target/README.md).

```
packages/electron   Electron main process: SSH/SFTP engine, config, IPC
packages/ui         SvelteKit UI: dashboard, terminal, SFTP, automations, settings
```

**Releases are automatic:** every merge to `main` runs all tests and, if it contains a
`feat`, `fix` or `perf` commit, publishes a new release for all platforms. The details
are in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#8-releases).
